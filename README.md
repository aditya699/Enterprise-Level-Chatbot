# Enterprise Chatbot Foundation

A robust foundation for building enterprise-grade chatbot applications, demonstrating core architecture and essential features for scalable AI-powered chat interfaces.

## Overview

This project serves as a starting point for developing enterprise-level chatbot applications. It implements crucial backend infrastructure, security features, and data management patterns that are essential for production deployments. While the frontend is intentionally minimal, the backend architecture showcases professional patterns that can scale.

## Key Features

### Authentication & Security
- Google OAuth2.0 integration for secure user authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Secure cookie handling
- Session persistence in database
- Rate limiting capabilities (configurable)

### Database Architecture
- SQL Server integration with connection pooling
- Robust error handling and connection management
- Structured schema for:
  - User profiles
  - Session management
  - Message history
- Prepared statements for SQL injection prevention

### Message Management
- Persistent message history
- Structured message storage with timestamps
- User/Bot message differentiation
- Support for message types (text, code, tables, etc.)
- Background for implementing rich media support

### API Design
- FastAPI implementation for high performance
- Clean route organization
- Type checking with Pydantic models
- Error handling middleware
- Async support for scalability

### Integration with AI Models
- Anthropic Claude integration (easily adaptable for other AI providers)
- Timeout handling
- Retry mechanisms
- Response streaming capability foundation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- SQL Server
- ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your environment variables
5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.create_tables
   ```
6. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Frontend Development

While this repository focuses on backend architecture, a production chatbot requires sophisticated frontend development. Key areas for frontend enhancement:

- Rich message formatting
- Code syntax highlighting
- Table rendering
- Image/media display
- Real-time typing indicators
- Message status indicators
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features
- Progressive loading
- Offline support

## Scaling Considerations

### Database
- Implement sharding for message history
- Add caching layer (Redis)
- Archive old messages
- Implement soft deletion

### Backend
- Add load balancing
- Implement message queues
- Add WebSocket support
- Enhance monitoring and logging
- Add analytics tracking

### AI Integration
- Implement prompt management
- Add context window management
- Support multiple AI providers
- Add failover mechanisms
- Implement content filtering

## Security Notes

- Implement rate limiting
- Add input sanitization
- Enable CORS properly
- Add API key management
- Implement audit logging
- Add content scanning
- Enable SSL/TLS
